# Colon ion and fluid transport FTU
This project contains the CellML bond graph modules and circulatory autogen input files for generating a functional tissue unit (FTU) of ion and fluid transport in the distal colon.

# How to use
## OpenCOR installation


## Circulatory autogen installation
This project uses the model generation capabilities of [Circulatory autogen](https://github.com/FinbarArgus/circulatory_autogen/tree/master) to couple modules into the distal colon FTU. Follow the [getting started](https://github.com/FinbarArgus/circulatory_autogen/blob/master/tutorial/docs/getting-started.md) documentation to install circulatory autogen.
